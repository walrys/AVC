# The simple implementation of extracting multiple types of traditional acoustic features,
# consisting of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC), Zero-Crossing Rate, Melspectrogram,
#  and Root-Mean-Square features.

# Input: an original audio clip.
# Output: multiple types of acoustic features.
#   Please note that, 1. you need to select suitable and reasonable feature vector(s) to represent the video.
#                     2. if you select mfcc features, you need to decide how to change the feature matrix to vector.

# More details: http://librosa.github.io/librosa/tutorial.html#more-examples.
